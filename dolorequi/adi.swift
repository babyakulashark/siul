/// In the example above:
/// - The `VStack` groups all the elements vertically.
/// - Inside the `VStack`, an `HStack` groups two `Text` views horizontally.
/// - A `ZStack` is used to overlay a text over a circle shape.
///
/// This compositional approach simplifies the management of complex UI by breaking it
/// down into smaller, reusable components.
